# Final-Project

We were tasked with playing the role of a Security Engineer that supports the SOC infrastructure.
The SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate.
I started by confirming that newly created Kibana alerts are working, after which I monitored live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.
